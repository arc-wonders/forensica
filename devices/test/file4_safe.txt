I love hiking in the mountains and exploring nature trails. There’s something incredibly peaceful about being surrounded by trees, hearing the rustle of leaves, and breathing fresh air. Last weekend, I hiked the Crystal Lake trail, which has some breathtaking views of the valley below. I even spotted a family of deer drinking water from a stream. The trail wasn’t too crowded, which made the experience even more enjoyable. I plan to visit the same area next month and explore the ridge trail as well.
