The group was planning an attack using explosive materials acquired illegally. Messages recovered from their communication channels suggest they had been coordinating this for months. The suspects were discussing possible targets and scheduling the operation for a high-traffic day to maximize disruption. Authorities believe that the group may have international links and are expanding the investigation. Some of the language in the messages included references to “the cause” and “a necessary sacrifice,” which raised additional concerns of terrorist activity.
